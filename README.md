# GPTZero Environment and AI Text Detection Tool

## Overview

This project provides an environment for detecting AI-generated text using a pre-trained model. The script processes `.txt` files in a designated directory, analyzes their content, and outputs the probability that the text was generated by AI. Results are saved in both JSON and Excel formats for further analysis.

---

## Features

- Detects AI-generated text using the **Roberta-base-openai-detector** model.
- Processes `.txt` files in bulk.
- Saves results in both `.json` and `.xlsx` formats.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (or higher)
- GPU support is optional but recommended for faster processing.

Dependencies:

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `pandas`
- `openpyxl`
- `xlsxwriter`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EnzoHaegel/AI_detector
   cd AI_detector
   ```
2. **Run the Setup Script**
   The script initializes the environment, installs dependencies, and prepares everything for execution.

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Files**

   - Place `.txt` files in the `documents` directory.
2. **Run the Script**

   ```bash
   python detect_ai_text.py
   ```
3. **View Results**

   - Results will be saved in:
     - `ai_detection_results.json`
     - `ai_detection_results.xlsx`

## Notes

- Ensure Python 3.9 is installed before running the setup.
- GPU support is recommended for faster analysis, but the script will work with CPU.
- If the `documents` folder does not exist, create it manually.
