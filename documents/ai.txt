The city lay beneath a dense cloak of fog that morning, its familiar landmarks transformed into vague silhouettes fading into the pale, diffused light. Pedestrians, wrapped in thick scarves and heavy coats, moved slowly along glistening sidewalks, unsure of their next steps on streets half-erased by swirling mist. In a quiet corner of the old quarter, a modest bakery had just opened its doors, releasing the warm scent of freshly baked bread into the damp air. Through the steamed-up window, one could see the baker, her apron dusted with flour, kneading a soft, pliant dough in steady, measured strokes. Her face, tinged with exertion, revealed both the weariness of early hours and the resolve to shape something nourishing. Nearby, a stray gray cat lingered before a shuttered shopfront, hoping that a hurried passerby might drop the tiniest morsel. Overhead, streetlamps still glimmered dimly, their glow fractured and blurred. The world felt gentler here, as if the mist itself were whispering a quiet invitation to discover its hidden, delicate secrets.
